## 💡 Business Insights & Recommendations
Based on the exploratory data analysis:

- **Peak sales were observed during specific high-demand periods.**
- **Top-performing products were identified based on both revenue and sales volume.**
- **Certain regions underperformed and may benefit from promotions or strategic marketing.**
- **Products with higher profit-to-cost ratio show scale potential.**
- **Slower-moving products may require stock optimization or bundling strategies.**

Specific numerical values were intentionally omitted. However, all insights are supported by the visual trends and analysis within the notebook and can be discussed during a live demonstration if required.
