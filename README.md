Retail Sales Analytics is a complete data-analysis workflow designed to demonstrate how a data analyst works with real-world business data.
The project explores sales performance, customer behavior, and future revenue forecasting using Python, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.

The dataset includes ~3,500 retail transactions from 2023–2024 across multiple cities, product categories, price levels, and purchase types.
