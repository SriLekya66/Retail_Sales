## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes retail sales data to uncover meaningful insights related to revenue trends, product performance, customer behavior, and business growth opportunities. It demonstrates expertise in data cleaning, transformation, visualization, KPI development, and actionable insight generation.

Note: Exact numerical values are intentionally omitted from this documentation. The focus is on trend interpretation and insight generation. Detailed results are available in the notebook and can be discussed during a live demonstration if required.

## 🔎 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Converting fields (e.g., dates to datetime)
- Standardizing categorical variables
- Creating additional fields (Month, Year, category codes, etc.)
- Calculating KPIs such as Revenue and Profit

---

## 📈 Key Analyses Performed
- Monthly Sales Trend – Identifies recurring patterns and seasonality
- Product & Category Performance – Highlights high- and low-performing areas
- Region-Wise Sales Comparison – Evaluates market contribution across locations
- Profitability Assessment – Includes revenue-cost evaluation and profit ratio analysis


---

## 💡 Business Insights & Recommendations
- Sales demonstrated seasonal variability with certain periods showing higher demand.
- Some product categories consistently outperformed others in terms of overall contribution and profitability.
- Regional performance varied, indicating potential opportunity for market-driven strategies.
- Products with a strong profit-to-cost alignment show scalability potential.
- Slow-moving products could benefit from strategies such as bundling, inventory optimization, or discount-based promotion.

(All insights are presented qualitatively. Numerical figures and supporting graphs can be discussed during the live demonstration if required.)
